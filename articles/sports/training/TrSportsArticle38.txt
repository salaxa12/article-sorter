• Box score

Game notes: The Spartans enter fresh off an ugly loss and an even uglier postgame scuffle with the rival Michigan Wolverines. A win vs. the Illini, who already have their most wins in a decade, would lift spirits amid a rough season for Mel Tucker and the Spartans. Illinois beat Nebraska last week and has won six straight.

For MSU to be competitive, they'll have to stop running back Chase Bown, the nation's leader at 1,208 yards on a nation-leading 224 carries. But quarterback Tommy DeVito has been a solid complement as well, completing 72% of his passes for 1,594 yards, 12 touchdowns and two interceptions. The Spartans rattled off nine straight victories in the series from 1995 to 2005, with seven of those winning margins coming by two possessions or more. However, Illinois has won the past two meetings and three of the last six.
