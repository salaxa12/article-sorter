“Continuing to have them around on the field is obviously great for us, but at the same time, I think off the field is where the real benefit is,” said James Click, Houston’s third-year general manager. “Because as we continue to bring new players up, as we continue to have new personnel come in, as we continue to have turnover on our roster, those are the guys who establish the culture and expectations of what it means to be a Houston Astro, what it takes to be successful not only at this level, but in the postseason and deep into the postseason.”

They have grown as comfortable together as old friends over the years. Their respect for each other is evident as the wins pile up and the accolades flow.

“The common thing from both of them is consistency,” Bregman said of Altuve and Gurriel. “They’re both the same guy every single day when they show up to the ballpark. They get their work in, they have fun, there’s a smile on their face. They’re great teammates. They root for their teammates.

“Two winners.”

From Altuve, Gurriel said, he has learned how to make small adjustments in his plate appearances, especially against the harder-throwing pitchers that he did not face often in Cuba or Japan. From Bregman, he said, he’s learned some English and reciprocated by teaching some Spanish to the third baseman.

“Since I got here, I’ve had the fortune of having guys like Altuve, Latinos who taught me a lot about getting used to this new life and this new period of how to play baseball here,” Gurriel said in Spanish. “The same I can say about Bregman. Even though he was young, too, he helped me a lot.”

Together, they have comprised three-quarters of the Astros infield for the past six years — Gurriel at first base, Altuve at second and Bregman at third. Off the field, they have been the human beakers in that ever-changing yet ever-consistent Houston clubhouse chemistry.
