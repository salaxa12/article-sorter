Michigan State shook off a turmoil-filled week and snapped No. 16 Illinois’ six-game winning streak with an impressive 23-15 victory Saturday. Illinois coach Bret Bielema took a peek at the stats and noticed the Illini had 147 more yards of offense, seven more first downs, and it even won the time of possession battle by nearly four minutes. But the Illini went just 6-for-17 on third down and 1-for-6 on fourth down, including a pivotal missed opportunity on fourth-and-goal from the 2-yard line in the first quarter.

All-American candidate Chase Brown rushed for 136 yards. Tommy DeVito completed 25 of 37 passes for 288 yards and connected with Isaiah Williams for two touchdown strikes. But Michigan State (4-5, 2-4 Big Ten) took advantage of multiple Illinois (7-2, 4-2 Big Ten) miscues on special teams.

"It felt like every time we were trying to get ahead, something pulled us back," Bielema said. "A lot of these were self-inflicted. Told the guys in the locker room, ‘This is the definition of how to lose a game.’ Statistically, did a really good job in certain of things, but statistics are what they are. They’re on a stat sheet. They don’t help. It’s going to be a hard one for these guys."
