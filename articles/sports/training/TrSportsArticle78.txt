One of the city’s biggest events will be back in full force this weekend.

The 2022 New York City Marathon takes place Sunday. It will return to full capacity this year, with 50,000 runners expected to participate.

"It's another sign that things are back — coming back to scale, back to normal and welcoming our family or friends from all over the world," the marathon's race director, Ted Mettelus, told Rocco Vertuccio and Shannan Ferry Saturday morning on NY1.

A giant crowd of spectators will be present again as well.

"It's truly a celebration," Mettelus said. "This is a chance for people to truly come together as a city and as a community, welcoming runners from around the world and around the corner."

It it expected to be a perfect day for the crowd — the forecast says the weather will be sunny with highs in the 70s. For runners, though, that weather is a little hot.

Marathon organizers are encouraging racers to hydrate, wear light clothing and pace themselves.

"Hydrating, often and early, wearing light apparel," Mettelus said. "It's been a lot of communication with the athletes to listen to their bodies, pace themselves. Tomorrow's not the day to have a [personal record].”

The 26.2-mile race will wind through each of the five boroughs, ending in Central Park. There are various street and bridge closures across the city because of the marathon.
