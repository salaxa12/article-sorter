loser: clemson tigers

There are plenty of slices to be cut in Clemson’s blame pie after a deflating 35-14 road loss against Notre Dame. There’s ineffective quarterback play by DJ Uiagalelei. There’s a lack of separation by the Tigers receivers. There’s an offensive line that fails to consistently win at the point of attack. There’s a defense that — despite having five-star talent all over the place — just isn’t as good as it’s been in years past. There’s also stale and play-calling on the offensive side of the ball.

This makes it sound like Clemson is a bad football team. It’s not. The Tigers are good and this loss does nothing to harm their pursuit of an ACC title (probably vs. North Carolina in Charlotte). However, Clemson’s elevated itself to a different standard the last decade. The Tigers are measured by their ability to contend for national titles. And this version of Clemson isn’t close to good enough.

Dabo Swinney is an excellent, generational football coach. He’s built a modern dynasty at a place few would have expected. But, in order to return to the nation’s elite, he must be willing to adapt. Clemson must embrace the portal. Clemson must reach outside of its walls for new offensive ideas. Clemson, as Swinney has done at times in his career, must change.

This was a woeful night in South Bend. The offense managed just 281 yards. The quarterback situation was bungled (Uiagalelei was benched, then Cade Klubnik was after an interception, and then Uiagalelei threw a pick-6 about 90 yards the other way). It wasn’t nearly as ugly as the 2012 Orange Bowl, when Swinney clearly saw he had to fire Kevin Steele (and then hired Brent Venables). But there needs to be some staff accountability. Fresh ideas are needed. The Tigers have to change what they do. If they don’t, they risk inching further and further from yearly contention.
