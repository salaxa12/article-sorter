• Baker now has two titles spanning 41 years from 1981 to 2022. No individual in baseball history had ever had his title-winning ways reach across that many trips around the sun. The prior longest stretch between first and last World Series win, regardless of how many were won in the middle, belonged to Casey Stengel, per Elias. He won in 1922 as a player, then in 1949-53, ‘56 and ‘58, not to mention the fact that the Giants won in 1921, too, though he did not play in the playoffs.
