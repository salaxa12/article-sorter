HOUSTON — For all of Darren Baker’s life, his father had chased a championship. That was Dusty Baker’s job, from San Francisco to Chicago to Cincinnati to Washington to Houston, and he always did it quite well. He just never got the ending right.

The harshest came in 2002 when Darren was a three-year-old bat boy, bawling in his father’s arms in the dugout after Game 7 of the World Series in Anaheim, Calif. Now he is a minor league infielder — a peer, of sorts, with his famous father. They never talk about what’s been missing.

“It was unsaid,” Darren Baker said on Saturday night at Minute Maid Park. “Just me kind of being in the same field, I understand it. You don’t do this for any other reason. I get it. The stars kind of have to line up for you to win.”
