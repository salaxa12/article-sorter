After the game, head coach Shane Beamer expressed how proud he was of his team on Saturday night.

"First of all, wish Vanderbilt a ton of luck," Beamer said. Clark has a team that continues to battle and fight every single week. They continue to improve and get better. Just really, really proud of our guys of our guys and the way that they competed tonight and played. Even more proud of just the way they responded to a disappointment last week against Missouri. Obviously, we did not play or coach well in that game. There was a lot of outside noise last week that, a lot of which we created. Our guys just kept blinders on and went back to work. Sunday night, when I came in and got on that teleconference and told you guys, ‘Sorry I was little bit late because we had a heck of a practice and a spirited practice, energetic practice.’ That was the truth. I knew last Sunday night we were going to be alright tonight. We have a great group of kids on this team that love to work and love to get better.
