Mike Leach has been upset with Mississippi State’s wide receivers for a while, and during the game against Auburn, it appeared that the coach was irritated again.

Leach had a talk with the pass catchers on the sideline, and after the chat, Leach folded up 6 chairs on the sideline.

The Bulldogs have made 3 turnovers in a 24-19 game against Auburn, and the Tigers have received the ball several times on the State side of the field.

The Bulldogs had 10 receivers make at least 1 catch, and overall there were 30 catches for 265 yards and 2 touchdowns in the Auburn game.

The Bulldogs are 4-for-12 on third down conversions.

Leach’s behavior recalled his rant from earlier this season about the receivers’ hands.

“Well I think we need to use our hands better. We don’t move our hands very good. You know, when I was a kid and I was in grade school, there was this nice big dinosaur guy. I can’t remember the gas station, but they would give you a free dinosaur [toy]if you filled up there. That’s back when they had commercials on TV and then they would give something to the kids like me,” Leach said. “And then the idea was that you should raise hell with your parents every time you’re in the station wagon. We had one, a good classic like one off the Wonder Years, one of those fake woody ones, you know, fake painted-on wood. But then the best is it would always without exception the finish and the varnish on it would peel. So then it looked more bogus than ever.”
