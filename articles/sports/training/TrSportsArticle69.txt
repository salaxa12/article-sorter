BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Welcome to my report card from No. 15 Penn State’s 45-14 bounce-back win over unranked Indiana here Saturday. For the second-time this season, the Nittany Lions shook off a tough loss to a Big Ten power by dominating a team they were supposed to dominate the very next week.

And that is not meant as a backhanded compliment to James Franklin’s program, which improved to 7-2 overall and 4-2 in the league. In winning a combined 11 games in 2020 and ’21, PSU had a maddening propensity to allow the frustration of one loss to lead to a second — and third and fourth and … well, you get the picture.

Not this year. In fact, heading into this game, Penn State closed as what seemed to be a head-scratchingly low -13.5 favorite. The Lions blew past that in the first half. And they blew out the Hoosiers (3-6, 1-5) on a windy afternoon in the second.

As usual, your feedback is encouraged. Your report card, too.
