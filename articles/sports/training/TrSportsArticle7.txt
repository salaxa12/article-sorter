NFL Week 9 Weather Conditions (Fantasy Football)

The weather looks great this week – enjoy it while it lasts. We’re likely to see some more wintry weather in the next few weeks. There are some breezy conditions for most of the outdoor games this week, but nothing that looks too threatening.

There are some forecasts calling for 20 mph+ sustained winds during parts of the game in Cincinnati but most forecasts have winds significantly less than that. We’ll keep an eye on it, but I’m thinking we’ll see winds around 15-17 mph. Some forecasts are calling for rain late in the game in Tampa Bay but most forecasts are calling for a dry game. Either way, it’s worth keeping an eye on it.

As always, updates will be posted below regularly with a final look around 12:30 p.m. EST.
