HOUSTON — They leaned against the dugout railing like colts waiting for the starting gun. The 2022 Houston Astros stood shoulder to shoulder, eyes darting up and down the line, brimming with anticipation, as closer Ryan Pressly prepared the season’s final pitch. It produced an awkward swing and an ungainly pop-up, one which fell into the glove of outfielder Kyle Tucker. By then, even before Houston’s 4-1 victory over the Phillies in Game 6 of the World Series had become official, almost every Astro was standing on the field, soaking in a championship.

There were hugs and handshakes. Confetti rained from the rafters. The Minute Maid Park train whistled and fireworks exploded and all of it consummated a reality that had become clear as this postseason approached its conclusion.

After all the gnashing of teeth by executives watching their teams with 100-plus victories fall, after all the rending of garments by Major League Baseball officials as big television markets bit the dust, after all the posting by cranks still irritated by the intrusion of the wild card in 1995 — after all that, guess what? The best team won.

“You have to give credit where credit is due,” Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos said. “They’re a hell of a ball team.”

How else to describe the Astros? The team operated like a champion for the duration of the season, from the end of the lockout to the final out on Saturday at Minute Maid Park. Houston won 106 games in the regular season, 16 more than their closest competitor in the American League West. The team went undefeated in the seven games against American League competitors in the postseason. In the World Series, the Astros weathered a series of haymakers from the Phillies, a flawed but fearless foe, the type of team this month often glorifies. If Houston required an exclamation point, one came in Game 4, the first World Series no-hitter since 1956.

And so it was that the last team left standing was also the best. In baseball, it does not always happen that way. But when it does, it offers a rejoinder to all who throw up their hands and cry “Variance!” when things go awry in October. This is not a new debate. It only got more invigorated this season as more teams entered the postseason fray.

The easiest way to analyze the disconnect between regular-season success and playoff triumph is to view the two contests as disparate events. The 162-game slog rewards the deepest and most versatile rosters — you can’t luck your way into 100 wins. The scramble of the postseason benefits the team that enters the bracket at its apex and maintains that level for the final sprint, as the Braves did in 2021 and the Phillies almost did this year. There is truth in both sentiments. The fear among some, myself included, was that by diluting the postseason to include 12 teams in 2022, Major League Baseball ran the risk of disincentivizing teams from attempting to build juggernauts: Why try to be great when being good was enough to win it all?

The early rounds of this postseason resurrected all these arguments. A succession of upsets prompted hearty discussion about the merits of the expanded format. In the wild-card round, the 101-win Mets fell to the 89-win Padres. San Diego further upset the apple cart by trouncing the 111-win Dodgers. Across the country, the Phillies marauded past the 101-win Braves.

As these teams licked their collective wounds, they pondered what, exactly, had just happened. The postseason wasn’t going to get smaller, everyone understood. “Expanding the playoffs, it brings in a lot of revenue, so I don’t think it’s going to go backwards,” Astros pitcher Justin Verlander said before the American League Championship Series.

What the heck happened? There were a lot of theories. Maybe the first-round bye wasn’t all that great, after all. The Dodgers and Braves were upended despite the time off. The idea of further expansion, like increasing the Division Series from five games to seven, was also floated. In Los Angeles, where the Dodgers once again lamented an early exit, the conversation centered around the team whiffing with men on base.

“During the course of the season, we had peaks and valleys with runners in scoring position — and this was a valley,” Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said a few days after his team was ousted. “The question is: Is it baseball, or are there things we can do to improve upon that? Are there levers we can pull? Are there things to put us in a better position there?”

The easiest answer was also the most challenging to implement: Play better. This is what champions do. That is what the Astros did all postseason.

When Friedman used the word “baseball,” he was not talking about the sport in the romantic sense. He was talking about the game’s inherent chaos. A generation of executives has absorbed the reality that randomness rules in October. Weird stuff happens.

All of this is true. But elite teams are still allowed to win.

Here is a weird thing that happened: In Game 1 of the American League Division Series, the 90-win Mariners taxed Verlander for six runs in four innings. Seattle held a four-run lead in the eighth inning. Then Alex Bregman hit a two-run shot and Yordan Alvarez detonated a three-run walk-off bomb. A game later, Alvarez erased another deficit with a go-ahead blast. Houston swept the Mariners two days later.

This is what champions do. That is who the Astros are.

There were chances for Houston to lament the format, or whine about having so many days off, or ponder existential questions about the game’s cruelty. Instead, at every turn this October, the team just played better than its opponent. When Verlander faltered, Framber Valdez and Cristian Javier starred. When Alvarez went cold, rookie Jeremy Peña stepped up.

That is what it takes. But that is also all it takes.

There was a moment in the eighth inning of Game 5 that didn’t get much attention. The sequence lacked the strategic precision of Trey Mancini’s rally-squashing scoop later that inning or the physical bravura of Chas McCormick’s wall-scaling grab in the ninth. But it demonstrated the steely reserve of this team and the waves of talent populating its roster.

Down two runs in the eighth, the Phillies mounted a comeback against Rafael Montero, one of half a dozen devastating options in manager Dusty Baker’s bullpen. An RBI single by second baseman Jean Segura cut the lead to one and placed runners at the corners with one out. Baker called upon closer Ryan Pressly to stymie the threat and complete a multi-inning appearance for just the second time since July 14.

Into the box stepped Brandon Marsh, a 24-year-old outfielder with an unruly beard and a moist mane. Marsh is a promising player, the youngest Phillie. He also strikes out about 35 percent of the time. In this instance, all he needed to tie the game was a well-placed grounder or a fly ball deep enough for a sacrifice. FanGraphs projected Philadelphia’s chance to win the game at 49 percent — a coin flip away.

Pressly would not even permit contact. A 33-year-old two-time All-Star, Pressly capitalized on Marsh’s youthful exuberance. Marsh saw three sliders. He took big hacks at all of them. The first caught the top of the plate, but Marsh swung late and fouled it off. The second darted inside, away from Marsh’s barrel, for another foul ball. The last slider landed untouched in catcher Martin Maldonado’s glove. Marsh had swung so hard he had fallen to a knee. In orderly fashion, Pressly had tilted the balance back toward Houston.

This is what champions do. That is who the Astros were in 2022. It doesn’t always happen this way. But this year, it was clear. The best team won.
