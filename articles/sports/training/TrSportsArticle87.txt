Opening remarks ...

“Well, first of all, I tip my hat to Mississippi State. Wow. Now, what a game; those kids fought hard. Sometimes you play this game of football, and you’re not going to win them all, but I am so proud of my guys. They fought. Two things that we talked about all week was serve and believe. I think those guys exemplified it. They showed that. So, my message to those guys was we’re not going to take this as a loss. Yeah, we didn’t complete the mission yet; we lost, but there’s so many, so many, so many life lessons. So many life lessons that these kids are going to learn from. I mean, not to shine a light on it, but just last night we had chapel; like eight guys gave their life to Christ. Like, I mean, like I told them guys last night, man: We can’t lose, no matter what happens tomorrow. So, I mean, I’m proud of those guys, truly proud of them.”
