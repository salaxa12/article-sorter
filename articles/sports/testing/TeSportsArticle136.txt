FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)—Caroline Garcia claimed the last spot in the semifinals of the season-ending WTA Finals with a 4-6, 6-1, 7-6(5) round-robin victory over Daria Kasatkina on Saturday.

The sixth-ranked Frenchwoman became the first in 30 matches this season to beat Kasatkina after losing the first set to the No. 8 player.

A tense third set that included a 10-deuce game in which Kasatkina finally held serve for a 5-4 lead ended in the tiebreaker when a scrambling Kasatkina put a volley into the net.

Garcia and Kasatkina played the winner-take-all match after both lost to top-ranked Iga Swiatek and beat 18-year-old American Coco Gauff in group play.

Swiatek had already clinched the top spot in the group. She and Gauff were set to wrap up singles play Saturday night.
