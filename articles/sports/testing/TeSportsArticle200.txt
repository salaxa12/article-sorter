EAST LANSING, Mich. -- The No. 5-ranked University of Michigan wrestling team crowned four champions -- two apiece in the freshman/sophomore and open divisions -- and boasted 11 total placewinners at the annual Michigan State Open on Saturday (Nov. 5) at the Spartans' Jenison Field House.

Senior/junior Cole Mattin and fifth-year senior Mason Parris won at 141 pounds and heavyweight, respectively, while freshmen Rylan Rogers and Ira Jenkins captured the 184 pounds and heavyweight freshman/sophomore titles in their collegiate debuts.

Mattin, ranked 16th in the latest InterMat poll, went 4-0 and earned two wins over ranked opponents, including a 5-4 overtime decision against Oklahoma's 25th-ranked Mosha Schwartz in the championship final. Mattin rallied from an initial deficit to Schwartz and used a low single-leg takedown early in the third to pull himself back into the match. The aggressor throughout, he drew a stall warning in the third and, after several more unanswered shots, earned a match-ending stall point 45 seconds into the sudden-victory frame. Mattin also earned a win by injury default over Ohio State's seventh-ranked Dylan D'Emilio at the 2:24 mark; he was leading 5-2 at the time after two first-period takedowns.

Parris, ranked No. 3 nationally, rolled to a 5-0 record with five bonus wins to capture his third career MSU Open title. He beat Oklahoma's 18th-ranked Josh Heindselman, 12-1, in the championship behind four takedowns, a pair of stall points and 4:37 in riding-time advantage. Parris opened the day with three first-period pins in just a combined 5:38 before earning another major decision in the semifinals.

Rogers also earned bonus in all of his wins, albeit in a smaller bracket; he went 2-0 on the day and earned a 13-5 major decision against Michigan State's Kael Wisler in the 184-pound freshman/sophomore final. Rogers scored on five takedowns against Wisler -- two apiece in the first and second periods -- and rode for 2:22.

Jenkins was 4-0 en route to the heavyweight freshman/sophomore title and defeated Wisconsin's Brooks Empey 4-0 in the final. After a scoreless first period and a quick escape in the second, Jenkins rode out the third, tacking on two near falls late, to finish with 1:53 in riding-time advantage.

Graduate student Matt Finesilver took second place in his Michigan debut at 184 pounds with a 3-1 tournament record. He earned back-to-back 15-0 technical falls in his first two matches before ultimately falling to Ohio State's fourth-ranked Kaleb Romero 12-5 in the championship match.

The Wolverines will kick off the dual-meet portion of their 2022-23 slate with two duals in the Tar Heel State next weekend. Michigan will participate in the Battle at Bragg event next Friday (Nov. 11), taking on Campbell at 5 p.m. at Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, N.C., before facing North Carolina at 3 p.m. on Sunday (Nov. 13) at the Tar Heels' baseball field, Boshamer Stadium, in Chapel Hill, N.C.
