South Africa has once again choked in a major tournament having crashed out of the T20 World Cup with a shock 13-run loss to the Netherlands.

Chasing 159 to win, the Proteas stumbled to 8-145 in Sunday's Adelaide Oval encounter.

The stunning loss means South Africa will miss the semi-finals.

India will advance regardless of their result against Zimbabwe on Sunday night.

And the winner of Pakistan's clash against Bangladesh in Adelaide on Sunday afternoon will also progress.

The no-result match against Zimbabwe earlier in the tournament, which South Africa was on track to win before it was rained out, only adds to the nation's perpetual disaster with the white ball.

And South Africa's stunning capitulation had the cricket world in a spin.

The Netherlands had never defeated South Africa in any format, before sending them packing in the T20 World Cup.

And fans couldn't get enough of another upset at the World Cup.

I keep trying to convince people that South Africa's chokers tag is wrong, it is based on a very small sample.



South Africa keep responding by increasing the sample size. — Abhishek Mukherjee (@ovshake42) November 6, 2022

Story continues

On Sunday, the nervy Proteas' top-order failed to fire and they were 4-90 in the 13th over.

With six overs remaining, South Africa still needed another 60 runs.

They lost another two batsmen in the 16th over to slip to 6-113 and yet another in the 18th over to be 7-120 - the Proteas were in a midst of a 4-30 slump.

To compound their predicament, No.8 batsman Keshav Maharaj was hobbled by a left leg injury and forced to literally hop when running between wickets.

Maharaj and Kagiso Rabada required 26 runs from the final over but fell short.

Earlier, Dutchman Colin Ackermann top-scored with an unbeaten 41 from 26 balls in his side's 4-158.

The Netherlands' openers Stephan Myburgh (37 from 30 balls) and Max O'Dowd (29 from 31) featured in a 58-run partnership.

And Australian-born Tom Cooper, whose mother was born in Dutch New Guinea, struck two sixes in making 35 from 19 deliveries.

South African paceman Anrich Nortje continued his fine tournament, taking 1-10 from four overs, and left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj claimed 2-27.
