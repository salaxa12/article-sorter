MADISON, Wis. -- Interim head coach Jim Leonhard continues to make a strong case that he's the man for the job going forward.

Improving to 3-1 under Leonhard's watch, Wisconsin (5-4, 3-3) won back-to-back games for the first time this season, upending Maryland 23-10 in a Big Ten Conference crossover.

With less than ideal weather conditions, the Badgers pounded their way through the wind and the rain for 278 rushing yards. Sophomore Braelon Allen (119 yards) and senior Isaac Guerendo (114) each hit the 100-yard mark as UW had two tailbacks hit the century plateau for the first time since the Purdue win last season.

The Badgers improved to 4-0 all-time against the Terrapins, including 3-0 at Camp Randall Stadium. With three games remaining on the 2022 schedule, UW also improved to 39-8 (.830) in the month of November since 2010.
