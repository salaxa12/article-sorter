1. Not sure who in the Nebraska quarterback room will be back next year, but I'll always think NU didn't take advantage of Logan Smothers this season. The sophomore showed enough in last year's Iowa finale to merit at least a quarterback-run package to throw into games as an off-speed pitch to Casey Thompson's drop back game. Of course, that's not Mark Whipple's expertise and so it wasn't going to happen. But look at Saturday, as Chubba Purdy got the start and rambled for key first downs and yards in building a 10-0 lead. Defenses generally struggle against running quarterbacks. NU could have gotten more out of Smothers.

2. P.J. Fleck did his best to keep the Huskers in it at the end. After Gopher running back Mohamed Ibrahim was ruled to have gotten the first down late with no NU time outs left, the spot was close enough that Minnesota should have rushed up and ran a play. Instead, Fleck called time out. Then, the officials decided to review. Ibrahim was ruled short. And so, on fourth-and-half yard with one of the league's best rushers, Fleck decided to punt from midfield rather than ice the game. If you miss it, you still have the fourth-ranked defense in the country. Punting in that situation is a Big Ten move. NU over insides its 20 with 2:25 left. Minnesota survived.
