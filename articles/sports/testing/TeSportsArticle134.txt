Isaac Guerendo glided down the west sideline at Camp Randall Stadium, somehow managing not to step out of bounds during an 89-yard journey that took a shade under 12 seconds to complete.

The fifth-year senior tailback for the University of Wisconsin football team changed speeds to avoid traffic, tapping the brakes at one point before resuming his sprint. It was a thing of beauty, and he had 10 teammates on the field — plus dozens more on the sidelines — practically willing him to the end zone.

There haven’t been a ton of feel-good stories to emerge during a strange season filled with adversity for the Badgers, but Guerendo falls in that category. The author of the fifth-longest run in program history finished with a career-high 114 yards rushing in UW’s 23-10 victory over Maryland, a win that moved Jim Leonhard’s team one step away from becoming bowl-eligible and gave Guerendo a signature moment in a career that has tested his patience and resolve.

“He’s a perfect example of what a Badger should be,” said UW wide receiver Chimere Dike, whose downfield blocking allowed Guerendo to tightrope the sideline and ultimately have a clear path to the end zone. “He works super hard, he’s a great locker room guy. So for them to feel that success, we love to see it.”

“He doesn’t know, but it means so much to me just seeing all the things that he’s worked so hard to get back for, seeing that come to fruition on the field,” quarterback Graham Mertz said. “I’m so proud, love that guy with all my heart. That was special.”

Guerendo had appeared in 15 games before this season, in part because he’s been stuck behind some really good tailbacks but also due to bad luck with injuries. It’s mostly been nagging soft-tissue injuries with the exception of a freak episode last season in which Guerendo tore a ligament in his left foot — a Lisfranc injury — after it was stepped on during warmups before a game at Illinois.

That one required major surgery and kept Guerendo out for the final eight games in 2021, plus spring practice.

“It felt like every time he was going to break through, something happened,” Leonhard said. “To see him have the day he did today, it's just awesome.”

It would have been easy for Guerendo to bolt and find a new home in this transfer portal era. He’d arrived at UW as a wide receiver with sprinter’s speed before being moved to tailback, where he’s struggled to make much headway on the depth chart.

So why not leave in search of a change of scenery that could offer a fresh start and perhaps some better fortune on the injury front? I asked him that Saturday after his first career 100-yard game, and his answer blew me away.

“Considering that I’ve been injured my whole career, I think it would be doing everybody an injustice if I made that decision given that I haven’t really had the ability to do something (here),” Guerendo said. “Whenever I have been healthy, they’ve given me the opportunity.”

Chez Mellusi’s injury at Northwestern on Oct. 8 moved Guerendo into the backup spot behind Braelon Allen. They tag-teamed a running attack that needed to be good Saturday because awful weather conditions made it nearly impossible to do anything through the air.

Allen rushed for 119 yards, 5 more than Guerendo, and they both scored a touchdown. Guerendo’s burst in the second quarter gave UW a 14-0 lead and offered a glimpse of what the coaching staff thought he could be when he arrived as a member of the 2018 recruiting class.

“I think it was a hint,” Guerendo said.

The implication was that there could be more to come. Guerendo will graduate in December with a degree in personal finance. He said he likely will go through the Senior Day ceremony in three weeks but is considering a return in 2023 for a sixth season, an option he has after the NCAA decided not to count a 2020 season shortened by COVID-19 against athletes’ eligibility.

Guerendo could have folded at any point over the past five seasons but is still here, still fighting. His injury history has taught him to operate as if the next play will be his last, and he shared his mentality with reporters after the win over the Terrapins.

“Just to keep your foot on the gas,” he said.

Which is exactly what Guerendo did over the final 20 yards of his touchdown run Saturday. He’d slowed up enough to let Dike do his job, maintained his balance while tight-roping the sideline and broke into a sprint to the finish line.

This glorious moment five seasons in the making ended with Guerendo stopping on a dime and giving a mini-flex toward the crowd, a low-key celebration given his backstory and yet somewhat fitting: There was more work to be done.
