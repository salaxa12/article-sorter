Chase Elliott attempts to win his second title in three years when he gets behind the wheel for the 2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship at Phoenix Raceway on Sunday. Elliott, who took the crown in 2020, will be battling 2018 winner Joey Logano, Christopher Bell and Ross Chastain for the championship. The 26-year-old Elliott has won a series-high five races this season and leads all drivers with a 12th-place average finish in 2022.

Elliott is the +240 favorite in the latest 2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship odds from Caesars Sportsbook. Bell is listed at +325, Logano is +375 and Chastain is +400 while 2021 series champion Kyle Larson rounds out the top 2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship contenders at +1100. You'll want to check out the NASCAR at Phoenix predictions from Micah Roberts, the legendary Vegas bookmaker who pioneered wagering on racing, before locking in any 2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship picks of your own.

Roberts, a former Vegas bookmaker, was the first to offer expanded NASCAR betting, and now hands out NASCAR winners to his followers on SportsLine. Roberts is the nation's premier NASCAR betting expert, and his top pick, Elliott, won the YellaWood 500 last month at 12-1 odds.

He also correctly predicted Elliott to win the Jockey Made in America 250 last season, nailed the 2021 Coca-Cola 600 winner by hitting Kyle Larson's victory at 11-2 odds and was on point by targeting Elliott as the winner of the EchoPark Texas Grand Prix at 8-5 odds the previous week. In addition, Roberts nailed last year's GEICO 500 when he predicted Brad Keselowski to win at 14-1 odds. Anyone who has followed his picks has cashed tickets.

Now, Roberts has analyzed the field and odds for Sunday's NASCAR at Phoenix 2022 race. He's only sharing his winner and leaderboard at SportsLine.

2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship expert picks

One shocker: Roberts is low on Denny Hamlin, even though he's one of the top 2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship contenders. In fact, Roberts says Hamlin, who has posted 20 top-10 finishes in 34 career Cup Series starts at Phoenix, barely even cracks the top 10.

"Hamlin lost his chance at the Championship 4 in the most insane way possible last week at Martinsville as his four-point lead was erased on the last lap," Roberts told SportsLine. "Hamlin still is without a (Cup Series) title, although the racing gods have given him three Daytona 500 wins."

Another curveball: Roberts is high on Tyler Reddick, who is listed at +4000 in the latest NASCAR at Phoenix odds. The 26-year-old Californian recorded the first three wins of his Cup Series career this season, including one at Texas Motor Speedway in the playoffs during the Round of 12. Reddick posted back-to-back top-10 finishes early last month before crashing out in each of his last two starts.

"If this wasn't his last race with RCR and owner Richard Childress wasn't still angry about him leaving, I'd be betting Reddick for sure," Roberts told SportsLine. "He was third at Phoenix in March." You can see who else to back here.

How to make 2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship predictions

Roberts is high on a massive longshot who had a strong showing at Phoenix back in March. This driver is being underestimated by oddsmakers, and anyone who backs him could hit it big. You can only see who it is here.
