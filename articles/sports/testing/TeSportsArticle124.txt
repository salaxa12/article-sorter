Alex Ovechkin set the NHL record for most goals scored with one franchise, netting his 787th career goal with the Washington Capitals to break a tie with Hockey Hall of Famer Gordie Howe's career total with the Detroit Red Wings.

The record-breaking goal came on home ice in a 3-2 loss to the Arizona Coyotes Saturday night.

In the second period, Ovechkin posted his seventh goal of the season, a power-play tally with assists from Trevor van Riemsdyk and Anthony Mantha. Ovechkin tied Howe's mark Thursday night in Detroit when he netted his sixth goal of the season in a 3-1 loss to the Red Wings.

Ovechkin has spent all 18 years of his NHL career with the Capitals, who drafted him first overall in 2004. He has won nine goal-scoring titles, three Hart trophies as NHL MVP and the 2018 Conn Smythe trophy as playoff MVP in leading Washington to its lone Stanley Cup championship.

The left wing is the franchise leader in goals, points and games played.

"Obviously, it's a huge moment," Ovechkin said. "The last couple games, it was big milestones and unfortunately, we didn't get the win, but it's a special moment and it's nice to have both my kids, my wife, all the fans (here). My parents watched in Moscow. So it's a special moment."

Howe scored 786 goals in 1,687 games with the Red Wings from 1946-1971. Ovechkin is closing in on Howe's NHL career total of 801 goals, which is second all-time behind Wayne Gretzky's 894-goal record.

Mark Howe, Gordie's son and a Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman, believes Ovechkin will eventually pass both players.

"It's the way that Ovechkin has been scoring, and the pace that he does it. He's so big, so strong and so powerful," Mark Howe told ESPN last week.

Ovechkin signed a five-year, $47 million extension in July 2021 that will keep him in Washington through 2026.

The second-period goal gave the Capitals a 1-0 lead, and was scored on Coyotes netminder Karel Vejmelka. With overtime in sight, however, and the potential of Ovechkin playing in a 3-on-3 situation, Nick Ritchie spoiled the end result for Capitals fans, scoring the game winner at 19:24 of the third period. The goal was his second of the game and sixth of the season.

Mantha had a goal to go along with his assist for Washington. But the Capitals have lost four straight (0-2-2) while giving up a lead in each, and that was the biggest topic postgame. Darcy Kuemper made 23 saves in the loss.

"No excuses, obviously," Ovechkin said. "It starts from us leaders, and we can't blame (injuries) on it. Every player who plays in the NHL has some level to play, and obviously, we miss those guys. But right now, the situation is we have to pull on the rope with all our hands and don't panic and don't think it's over. We just have to bounce back and play together as a team and as a group."
