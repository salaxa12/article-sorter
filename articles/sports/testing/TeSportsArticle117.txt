In a division series sweep over the Seattle Mariners, Peña hit .250 (4 for 16) with one home run. He got better as the Astros advanced and the stakes grew higher, hitting .353 (6 for 17) with two home runs in an A.L.C.S. sweep of the Yankees, and then .400 (10 for 25) with one home run against the Phillies.

“He was a rookie in the regular season,” Astros left fielder Yordan Alvarez said in Spanish. “When the playoffs started, he was a veteran.”

“He’s been unbelievable,” Astros third baseman Alex Bregman added. “I mean, seriously, just so proud of him. He’s learned how to deal with success, learned how to deal with failure, and he’s been a man on a mission since he got here just to be himself.”

In an alternate universe, Correa accepted the team’s contract offer of $160 million over five years after the 2021 World Series. But in that scenario, where would the Astros and Peña be?

“You have to pick and choose sometimes and those decisions are never easy,” Astros owner Jim Crane said. “We knew Jeremy was a good player. We knew he had a lot of skills. Quite frankly, he exceeded our expectations and won two M.V.P.s. But that’s a judgment call at the time that he can fill the hole, maybe not a Carlos, but he proved to be just as good or maybe better, who knows?”
