Arkansas lost its first non-conference game under Sam Pittman on Saturday when No. 23 Liberty rolled into Fayetteville (Ark.) and left with a 21-19 win in front of a homecoming crowd of 70,072.

The Razorbacks (5-4, 2-3 SEC) were lifeless in the first half and trailed 21-3 at the break, but held the Flames scoreless in the second half and had a chance to extend the game with a 2-point conversion try with under a minute to play.

KJ Jefferson's keeper was ruled just short of the goal line, however, and the Flames (8-1) ran out the clock to seal the win.
