"Defensively, I was disappointed in the first half. Their three receivers are out, so you figure they're gonna run the ball, and they haven't run the ball all year. So we've got to handle that better. Because they start with a kickoff return for about 34 yards and have some excitement, enthusiasm and take it right down and score. And for some reason we don't start well offensively. So we've got to continue to look at that and see why we're not starting well in the in the first quarter offensively. And then we come out after halftime and we do really well for the third and fourth quarters. I was really proud of the defense that they stepped up and had three forced three-and-outs, immediately. The turnover they had in the first quarter led to points. But we've got to stop the run better.

"I'm really disappointed in the offense at the end that we didn't finish the game on offense. We had the ball twice with a 10-point lead -- you have got to finish the game. You've got to finish the game, and we didn't kill much clock or finish the game and you got to do that. So we've got to go back and and look at that because you can have a four-minute offense and still run your same offense and that was disappointing for us.

"But overall I felt like the guys understood where things are. Brennan Armstrong is one of the best quarterbacks the ACC has ever seen and to have him hit 17-of-35 with one interception is really good and he's hard to sack because he's so athletic. And he ran for 70-something yards but like Drake he's been their leading rusher so that was pretty good to keep him down inside.

"Give Tony Elliot credit, they played hard, they played well, and they gave themselves a chance to win so Tony's got things headed in the right direction. And give our kids and coaches a lot of credit. We're 8-1. I don't think we got anybody hurt today, and if we did it wasn't bad and we should be better next week. We were trying to fill some holes on defense today with moving this one around, we had Kaimon Rucker playing both places and it's confusing. The wheel route, we had Malaki Hamrick in there and he probably hadn't been in there enough to cover the wheel route. Jahvaree Ritzie was trying to play both places -- power end and three technique. And it was hot, it was humid, and we gotta get those backup guys so we can trust them more. We just we just have to do that."
