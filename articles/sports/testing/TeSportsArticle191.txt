After three rounds at the Toto Japan Classic, the trio of players atop the leaderboard at Seta Golf Course in Shiga had more to play for than merely a title. Momoko Ueda led by one, and as a member of the JLPGA in Japan, she would have the opportunity to accept full LPGA Tour status with a win. The same was true for Miyu Yamashita, who was two shots behind Ueda. For Gemma Dryburgh, who started the final round a shot back of Ueda, a victory would jump her far enough up the LPGA’s season-long points rankings to earn a spot in the 2022 season finale, the CME Group Tour Championship, which has one of the biggest purses in women’s golf.
