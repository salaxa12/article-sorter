It's been the month of Mattress Mack throughout the Houston Astros' run to the World Series.

Jim "Mattress Mack" McIngvale, Astros superfan and the owner of Gallery Furniture, gained national acclaim entering the Fall Classic due to his massive $10 million bet on Houston to win the 2022 World Series. And Mattress Mack's fame grew when the series turned to Philadelphia. McIngvale was filmed in a shouting match with Phillies fans after Game 3 of the World Series, an incident in which McIngvale says he was defending Astros second baseman Jose Altuve. You can question McIngvale's taste for the spotlight if you wish. But his love for the Astros seems beyond reproach.
