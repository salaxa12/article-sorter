No. 8 Oregon (8-1, 6-0) traveled to Boulder, CO, to take on the Colorado Buffaloes (1-8, 1-5) on a windy day that saw the Ducks come home victorious, winning 49-10.

The Ducks did a lot of damage in the third and early fourth quarters but had multiple highlights plays in the first half on their first three scores. The Ducks found the endzone with the help of one offensive tackle, one linebacker, and one quarterback but not what you think. Nix was the recipient of a touchdown pass from Bucky Irving as Josh Conerly Jr. and Noah Sewell also found the endzone in the first half.

Nix continued his excellent season with two touchdown passes and two touchdown runs, along with his touchdown reception. Nix once again combined for five touchdowns for the third time this season.

Christian Gonzalez made his trip back to Boulder and recorded two interceptions, bringing his career total up to three. Oregon's defensive backs had multiple opportunities to pick JT Shrout off but finished with two interceptions. The Ducks' lone hiccup of the day came on an 81-yard touchdown pass from Shrout to Jordyn Tyson.

Bryan Addison led the way on defense with six tackles and four solos, as he and Bennett Williams combined for three pass breakups as well.
