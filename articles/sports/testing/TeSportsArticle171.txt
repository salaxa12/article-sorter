Final: Pittsburgh 19, Syracuse 9

It was unseasonably warm but typical November football Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh.

No. 20 Syracuse lost a rugged game, 19-9, in which both sides looked willing to do whatever it took to hand this to the opponent.

Syracuse played without its starting quarterback. Pitt played without its star running back. SU’s backup quarterback finished 8-for-23 for 120 yards. Pitt’s backup running back rushed for a career-high 124 yards on 28 carries.

Enough said.

Incredibly, the Orange stared down a 99-yard drive in the final 2 minutes with a chance to tie. On the first snap, Carlos Del Rio-Wilson was sacked in the back of the end zone for a safety, and that was that.

SU couldn’t capitalize after Pitt needlessly threw away two interceptions down in the red zone, including a baffling double-pass play thrown by receiver Jared Wayne that was underthrown and easily picked off by Isaiah Johnson.

It coudn’t even cash in on Pitt’s punt that went barrelling toward the masses at scrimmage, resulting in a net of 2 yards and a golden opportunity to finally find the end zone.

Andre Szmyt’s long field died in a gust of wind, and SU’s national ranking went with it.

Until a 15-yard scramble by Del Rio-Wilson and his 45-yard completion to D’Marcus Adams, SU was net negative in second-half yardage midway through the fourth quarter. It finished with just 145 yards and an even 3 yards per play.

Syracuse (6-3, 3-2 ACC), lost its third game in a row and now stares at Florida State and Wake Forest, back-to-back opponents with explosive offenses and healthy starting quarterbacks.

It’s November, when bodies are worn down and depth is pushed. This time of year has often resulted in ugly outings like Saturday’s in Western Pennsylvania.

A 6-0 start didn’t change that.

Neither did a 75-degree day at kickoff.

Fourth quarter

Pitt drive starts 1:34 at Syracuse 31-yard line

Pitt will run it out, and Syracuse will fall to 6-3 on the season (and likely out of the polls).

SCORE UPDATE: Pittsburgh 19, Syracuse 9 with 1:35 remaining fourth quarter

Syracuse drive starts 1:40 at own 1-yard line

Pitt gets a safety on the first play of the drive; a Del Rio-Wilson sack.

Of course.

Pitt drive starts 4:52 at own 25-yard line

Cignetti cuts the cuteness and gives it to Hammond to start winding clock. He feeds Hammond again for a first down, and that’ll help the cause. Hammond has a career-high 103 yards on 23 carries.

Hammond picks up the second first down of the drive with about 2:30 remaining, and Dino Babers has to start thinking about using his three timeouts.

SU calls its first timeout with 2:03 remaining and the ball placed near midfield. Babers takes his second timeout with 1:54 left on the clock and 3rd-and-3 from the Syracuse 46-yard line.

Here we go.

Hammond is stopped just short of the first-down marker. Syracuse calls its final timeout with 1:49 left in the fourth quarter.

Pitt will show as if it will go for it to win the game. It takes the delay of game, as the crowd dislikes the decision.

SCORE UPDATE: Pittsburgh 17, Syracuse 9 with 4:52 remaining fourth quarter

Syracuse drive starts 7:45 at own 15-yard line

Syracuse had 94 yards of offense at halftime. With less than 7 minutes remaining, it had 92 before Carlos Del-Rio Wilson picks up 15 on the 3rd-down conversion.

Del Rio-Wilson misses for Gadsden, but the two have been unable to hook up all day.

That’a huge sack by Syracuse native SirVocea back at the 32-yard line.

That 6-yard loss makes a huge difference for Szmyt kicking into the wind.

His 49-yard kick is low and drilled through the uprights.

On 3rd-and-5 from the Pitt 37-yard line, Caleb Okechukwu throws Slovis for a 12-yard loss. Syracuse has life but must make up a couple scores.

Here’s a weird one: A punt is drilled into the masses near scrimmage, resulting in a 2-yard punt. The ball was illegally touched and downed at the Pitt 27-yard line.

Pitt drive starts 8:08 at own 35-yard line

C’Bo Flemister, the team’s fourth-string tailback, in the game now with Abanikanda out. He then makes a mean cut to reverse field and find grass on the edge.

On 3rd-and-2, Flemister grinds out the tough, 3-yard gain for a first down at the SU 28-yard line.

Nice pocket awareness by Slovis to feel the rush and step up to deliver a strike to Wayne down at the 1-yard line.

Pitt drive starts 10:37 at own 40-yard line

Naturally, Pitt pulls out a trick play. Jared Wayne’s pass is picked off by Isaiah Johnson. Ball was well underthrown.

Syracuse takes over on a baffling, double pass playcall.

Syracuse drive starts 12:26 at own 20-yard line

Devonshire drops an intercepiton as D’Marcus Adams and Del Rio-Wilson aren’t on the same page.

Slovis has a ton of time on the play-action and checks it down to Hammond for a short completion.

On 3rd-and-8 from the Pitt 42-yard line, Carter makes a tackle in 1-on-1 coverage to force a punt after the gain of 6 yards.

Halftime: Pittsburgh 10, Syracuse 6

It’s unseasonably warm but typical November football in Pittsburgh, as the Panthers and Orange played the opening 30 minutes in less than 90 minutes of real time.

Syracuse has two explosive plays, both on completions to Damien Alford.

Pitt has run the ball 20 times for 86 yards and the game’s only touchdown, a 6-yard score by Rodney Hammond.

The team’s No. 2 tailback, Hammond is elevated onto the top line with Israel Abanikanda, the ACC’s leading rusher, out for the game.

On 3rd-and-6, Del Rio-Wilson looks toward Alford down the left sideline.

Andre Szmyt will attempt a 48-yard field goal.

Another wonky kick by Von Marburg, this one still nets 40+ on the roll.

Vincent Davis with 8 on the first play of the drive. Davis then moves the chains.

Pitt converts on 3rd-and-short for a fresh set of down across midfield. Pitt has driven into SU territory on all three possessions of the first half.

Slovis then dumps it off to tight end Gavin Bartholomew, who fumbles out of bounds.

Pitt punts for the first time and commits another awful penalty. Trebor Pena fakes the fair catch and Karter Johnson nails him. It’ll be unnecessary roughness with targeting. Play is under review. There is no targeting. Johnson stays in the game.

SCORE UPDATE: Syracuse 3, Pittsburgh 0 with 0:26 left in first quarter

Syracuse drive starts 7:32 at own 20-yard line

On 3rd-and-1, Del Rio-Wilson takes a high snap and gives to Sean Tucker, who bounces it outside for a first down.

Chris Bleich called for his second false start in as many drives.

Del Rio-Wilson fires one out to Damien for a first down near midfield. Then M.J. Devonshire gets called for a defensive pass interference to advance the ball into Pitt territory down to the Pitt 41-yard line.

Pitt gets handsy here on the second series. A personal foul facemask on Habakkuk Baldonado makes it 1st-and-goal from the 8-yard line.

Tucker is short on 2nd-and-goal from the 1 to bring up 3rd-and-goal. SU goes fast and, and Tucker loses 4 yards.

Slovis’s second pass attempt promptly ends the drive.

Syracuse drive starts 14:54 at own 35-yard line

Enrique Cruz starting at right tackle for the Orange with Kalan Ellis out. Dakota Davis shifts inside to his natural guard spot on the left side next to Matthew Bergeron.

Syracuse gets nothing on its first two plays, then a presnap penalty on Chris Bleich.

On 3rd-and-long, Solomon DeShields sacks Del Rio-Wilson, and Syracuse goes three-and-out.

Pregame

Good afternoon from the Steel City, where the weather gods have blessed us with a 75-degree day on the first weekend of November.

Conditions are not completely immaculate. It will be gusty, with bursts of wind touching 20 mph.

How might that favor the home team, which leans on its ground game with the ACC’s leading rusher, Israel Abanikanda, and a defense that is stout up front and has talent at all three levels?

We’ll see.

But the one thing Pitt decidedly is not is explosive through the air. If the wind impacts playcalling, I expect it to affect Syracuse a bit more. The Orange has been balanced offensively, with Robert Anae’s Air Raid flavor helping SU start 6-0 earlier this season.

Garrett Shrader made the trip and is taking pregame snaps from Josh Ilaoa, the team’s No. 2 center. Carlos Del Rio-Wilson was working with first-team center Carlos Vettorello.

Left guard Kalan Ellis is here; defensive back Alijah Clark is not.

Big news on the Pitt side: Star running back Israel Abanikanda is not expected to play (injury-related). Rodney Hammond, the team’s No. 2 back, is a few weeks out since returning from an early season ankle injury.
