What to watch for: Jets QB Zach Wilson will attempt to rebound from a three-interception nightmare. It won't be easy. It never is against the Bills, who have held the Jets to 17 or fewer points in six straight meetings. The Bills, seeking their first 7-1 start since 1993, are tied for fourth in takeaways (14) -- a problematic matchup for Wilson & Co. -- Rich Cimini

Bold prediction: Josh Allen will throw at least three touchdowns with over 325 passing yards. Allen was frustrated after throwing two second half interceptions in the team's 27-17 win over the Green Bay Packers, and while the Jets defense has nine interceptions on the year and hasn't allowed over 300 passing yards in a game this year, Allen will use those bad decisions to bounce back. Much of the Jets defensive success has come in zone coverage (lowest QBR allowed), but Allen leads the league in QBR (81) and passing touchdowns (six) against zone coverage. -- Alaina Getzenberg

Betting nugget: New York is the largest home underdog by any team with a winning record since 2007. Buffalo is the second team in the last 40 seasons to be at least a 12-point road favorite over a team with a winning record, joining 2007 New England -- which did it twice.

Moody's pick: Bills 30, Jets 16
