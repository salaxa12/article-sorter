An inside look at Sunday’s Jets-Bills Week 9 matchup at MetLife Stadium.

Marquee matchup

Jets CB Sauce Gardner vs. Bills WR Stefon Diggs

Diggs is third in the NFL with 55 receptions and has the most touchdowns (seven) among wide receivers this year. Gardner has gotten off to a great start in his rookie season. He is credited with allowing just 13 yards in man coverage this season.

The Jets do not usually travel their cornerbacks, meaning Gardner likely won’t follow Diggs around. But he said he would welcome the challenge if he did. Even if Gardner and Diggs don’t face off on every snap, they will see plenty of each other, and this will be a good test for the Jets budding superstar.

Defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich said Gardner has a “Superman” mentality to him.

“[The best corners] have this mentality that they can never be beat. He’s got that to him,” Ulbrich said. “He’s got tremendous confidence. His football IQ for a rookie is way ahead of most — still got a long way to go in that way. His thirst for knowledge and the way he works and operates on a day to day basis is really cool to see. He’s got the makeup of a guy that’s played some time in this League, excited about the future.”

Costello’s call

This is a tough matchup for the Jets. The Bills do not appear to have any weaknesses at the moment. The Jets’ offense is still trying to find itself without Breece Hall, and the defense is going to struggle to stop Josh Allen.

Bills 30, Jets 13

Four downs

Miller time: The Bills’ core is mostly the same as it has been the past few years, with one very large exception. Buffalo signed edge rusher Von Miller to a six-year, $120 million contract in March, and he has already paid dividends. The 33-year-old has six sacks and is going to be a problem to deal with for Jets tackles Duane Brown and Cedric Ogbuehi. Miller missed practice time this week with an ankle injury, but he is expected to be full strength on Sunday.

“Still a force to be reckoned with,” Brown said. “When [the Broncos in 2021] made the trade to L.A., a lot of people wrote him off thinking he was kind of starting to decline, and he showed that that was wrong. Just a very talented athlete, man, very explosive, quick, crafty. He’s playing like he has something to prove, so it’s a great challenge.”

Get Zach back: The Jets are 4-1 with Zach Wilson starting at quarterback and had found a winning formula with stingy defense, a strong running game and Wilson protecting the ball. That went out the window last week against the Patriots when Wilson had three brutal interceptions. This week has been about getting Wilson back on schedule. We’ll see how he does against a Bills defense that has 14 takeaways this year.

“The mindset is within 24 hours, we’ve all moved on,” Wilson said of last week. “Now, I’ve learned from those mistakes. There’s things I want back, but those are behind me and you try to reapply them in practice.”

Looking for Moore: The drama around Elijah Moore continues. The wide receiver played just 10 snaps last week and had one target with no catches. The Jets did not trade him before the deadline Tuesday, and now it is on the coaches to figure out how to incorporate Moore into the offense.

“For sure we’ll find a way to make sure that it balances out the way we want it to,” head coach Robert Saleh said, “but at the same time — like I said with Corey [Davis] being down, getting [Denzel] Mims out there, keeping a bigger body out at the Z, and Garrett [Wilson is] playing at such a high level right now to give him the opportunity to play football too … we’ve got to make sure we find more opportunities to for [Moore].”

Status Q: Defensive tackle Quinnen Williams was named the AFC Defensive Player of the Month for October after a monster five games. Williams had 4.5 sacks, 23 tackles, four tackles for a loss, 12 quarterback hits, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and a blocked field goal in the month.

Williams will chase around Bills quarterback Josh Allen this week, a challenge he is looking forward to.

“He’s like huge,” Williams said. “He’s like 6-[foot]-5 I think, can stiff-arm, can run the ball, can jump, can hurdle. He’s basically like a running back who can throw the ball real good. He’s an elite quarterback. When he has to throw a deep ball, he has an elite arm. He’s a super powerful quarterback. Going against him is going to be a big challenge.”
