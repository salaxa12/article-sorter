Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games announced a native PS5 port for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge.

The new native PS5 port is coming on November 15th. While the game has been backwards compatible on both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, owners of the PS4 version of the game are not eligible for a free upgrade to the native PS5 port. Tribute Games noted the native PS5 port is identical to the PS4 version, though.

Limited Run Games and Merge Games (via Signature Edition Games) are both offering a physical edition for the game’s native PS5 port, and in various editions, too.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge has been available since June 2022 across Windows PC (via Steam), Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4 and on Xbox Game Pass. In case you missed it, you can check out our review for the game here – we highly recommend the game!
