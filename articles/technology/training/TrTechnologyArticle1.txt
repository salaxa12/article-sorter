Original: The Pokemon Company has just opened a new, mysterious website with a chest. There’s little to be seen at the moment aside from the chest itself, the number below it, and “000” in the top left corner. As far as we can tell there doesn’t appear to be much interactivity on the page.

Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet will be on Switch in just a couple of weeks, and if we had to guess, this teaser should tie into a reveal of a new Pokemon. New creatures for the games have been unveiled in different sorts of ways, though this particular method is a bit different.

You can access the new Pokemon chest website for yourself here, and it should be updated further in the future. At some point we should also have a concrete answer as to what this is about. Once we have more information, we’ll be sure to let you know.

Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet release for Switch on November 18, 2022.

Update: Not long after the site went up, it has already started to receive updates. The chest has opened and you can click on buttons “1” and “2” to see it from different angles.
