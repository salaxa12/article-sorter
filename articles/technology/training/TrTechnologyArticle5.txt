Overwatch 2‘s next hero, Ramattra, will be released next month.

The character, who has been part of the Overwatch lore for over three years since he first appeared during the Storm Rising event, will be a tank-class hero.

Revealed during the Overwatch League Grand Finals, Ramattra will join the roster on December 6. The game’s second season of content will also begin on this date.

“Originally a war machine, Ramattra shed his munitions for a shield to protect his people by promoting peace and tranquility,” reads Ramattra’s character description. “His ideals weren’t far removed from his fellow Shambli monk, Zenyatta. However, Ramattra’s story is one of hardships, trauma, and a magnified view of humanity’s harsh realities.

“Harmony was replaced by dissonance, and Ramattra began to approach his convictions from a more pragmatic angle—justifying any means necessary to defend his fellow omnics. As the leader of Null Sector, Ramattra boasts incredible support from his people, and he is primed to impose his philosophies on our world.”

It’s currently unclear if players will have to unlock the ability to play as Ramattra in competitive play, as was the case with the new hero introduced in season 1, Kiriko.

More than 25 million players played Overwatch 2 during its first ten days of availability, Blizzard claimed .

Overwatch 2’s huge engagement numbers are in spite of the numerous issues it’s experienced since launch.
