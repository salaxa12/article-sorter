World of Horror launches in Summer 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC

During today's Indie World Showcase presentation, Ysbryd Games announced that World of Horror will launch in Summer 2023.

Although the Indie World presentation was specifically for Nintendo Switch titles - and thus the trailer only shows a Switch logo - World of Horror will also launch for PlayStation 5 & PlayStation 4. The Steam version will leave Early Access at the same time, having originally launched in February 2020.

A new trailer, description, and screenshot set can be found below, via Ysbryd Games.
