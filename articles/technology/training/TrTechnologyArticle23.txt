(Image credit: Apple) MacBook Air M1: $999 $799 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) If you're on the hunt for an Apple laptop but don't want to pay top dollar, this is a great deal. Right now Best Buy has the MacBook Air M1 on sale for just $799 (opens in new tab). That's $200 off the regular price and the lowest price we've ever seen. As you'll see in our MacBook Air M1 review, this laptop offers strong performance from its M1 chip, and we saw a very impressive 14+ hours of battery life in our web surfing test. Other highlights include a vibrant 13-inch Retina display, comfy Magic keyboard and an improved webcam (thanks to Apple's chip). There is a newer MacBook Air M2 with an even faster processor, but you will not be disappointed if you scoop up this deal now.

Best Buy is dropping the price on Madden NFL 23, but the clock runs out on these savings by tomorrow (Nov. 6). Best Buy's deal — Madden NFL 23 for $39 instead of the usual $69 — applies to both the Xbox Series X/Series S (opens in new tab) and PS5 versions (opens in new tab) of the venerable football franchise. We found plenty to like about this year's version of the game in our Madden NFL 23 review, including the production values and the fast load times.

That's why this Best Buy deal on the foldable phone caught our eye. At Best Buy, when you activate the phone with Verizon, you can save $400 on the Galaxy Z Fold 4 (opens in new tab). The savings don't stop there — trade in a device, and you can potentially save up to $1,000 more on the phone. Best Buy and Verizon are offering a similar deal on the Galaxy Z Flip 4 ($200 off with activation, plus extra savings with a trade-in). The Galaxy Z Fold 4 is the more substantial of Samsung's two foldable phones, essentially letting you tote around a tablet in a smartphone's form factor. The Z Fold 4 benefits from an optional Galaxy S Pen, which boosts your productivity when it's time to sketch or edit photos on the expansive screen.

GoPro Hero 8 Black 4K: $299 $229 @ Amazon (opens in new tab) The weekend is here and there's a fresh batch of new deals to scan. The first one that popped on my radar comes courtesy of Best Buy/Amazon. Both retailers have the GoPro Hero 8 Black 4K on sale for $229. That's $70 off and the lowest price we've ever seen for this Editor's Choice camera. It's also a rare sale as this camera hardly ever goes on sale. Although it's not the latest model, we named the Hero 8 Black one of the best GoPro cameras under $300. In our GoPro Hero 8 Black review, we said it's worth the investment as it offers solid image stabilization, great video/audio quality, and a clean interface. Take note: this deal is valid through November 7 only. (I told you it was a rare discount).

(Image credit: Future) Unlocked Moto G Power (2021): $249 $129 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) The Moto G Power (2021) is one of the reigning champs when it comes to smartphone battery life. In our tests, it lasted an average of 14 hours and 4 minutes, which means you can get through the day — and then some — without having to charge your phone. While there is a newer 2022 model, that phone's lackluster CPU resulted in laggy app launches and overall disappointing performance, which makes the 2021 model the phone to get. In our Moto G Power 2021 review, we called it the best budget handset you'll find. It's even more tempting now that it's on sale.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide) Bella Pro 8-qt. Air Fryer: $109 $49 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) Save a whopping $60 with this Black Friday air fryer deal, which is now $10 cheaper than it was last week. The Bella Pro Series air fryer sports a built-in touchscreen that allows for fast and intuitive use. Its stainless steel construction is highly durable, and it has a powerful 1700w heating system. It's a good entry-level air fryer for anyone who wants to experiment with air frying, but doesn't want to drop upwards of $100 on a new appliance.

(Image credit: Best Buy) Samsung 75" TU690T 4K TV: $849 $579 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) Now here's a deal worthy of its Black Friday description. Best Buy currently has the Samsung 75-inch TU690T 4K TV on sale for $579. That's $270 off and one of the least-expensive big-screen Samsung TVs we've ever seen. Keep in mind that the Crystal Series is part of Samsung's budget/entry-level TVs. That said, you get HDR 10 Plus support and Alexa/Siri/Google Assistant compatibility. Gamers should take note that the TV only has two HDMI ports and a 60Hz panel, but at this price — it's still a killer deal.

(Image credit: Henry T. Casey) 8.3" iPad mini (64GB/2021): $499 $399 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) Apple deals are always a big part of any Black Friday sale, and Best Buy is offering a seriously impressive selection of savings on top Apple devices. For example, the iPad mini (2021) is $399 at Best Buy (opens in new tab), that's a massive $100 off its usual price. We rank the iPad mini 6 is one of the best tablets on the market. This is for a whole load of reason, but the punchy A15 Bionic processor is a good starting point. The tablet also sports a sharp, bright display, too. Plus we love the excellent webcam and the more universal USB-C charging. If you want ultimate portability and a tablet you can use one-handed, opt for the iPad mini 6.

(Image credit: Roku) Streaming device sale: Roku & Google from $17 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) My TV is about 12+ years old. Although it's a smart TV, it's actually not very smart. So I have a Roku Streaming Stick 4K connected to it. If you find yourself in a similar scenario — or if you just don't like the smart operating system that came with your current TV — Best Buy has multiple streaming devices on sale from $17. The sale includes a handful of Roku devices and the Google Chromecast with Google TV. Just one note — the Apple TV 4K is about $10 cheaper at Amazon. Amazon has it for $99 (opens in new tab), whereas Best Buy has it for $109 (opens in new tab).

The Samsung Freestyle is a 1080p portable (1.8-pound) projector that can project onto a variety of different surfaces from 30 to 100 inches. It features 360-degree sound and lets you summon Alexa or Bixby via its built-in smart assistant support. It's on sale for $599, which blows away all previous deals we've seen for this projector. Heads up, Amazon has it for $597 (opens in new tab), which is a tad cheaper.

(Image credit: Best Buy) Cuisinart SmartNest 12-Piece Nonstick Set: $169 $99 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) I admit — Best Buy isn't the first spot I got to for deals on kitchenware. However, they currently have a pretty sweet deal on this Cuisinart 12-piece set. They're offering the Cuisinart SmartNest 12-piece Nonstick set for just $99. That's $69 off and the best price I've seen for it on the Webs today. By comparison, Cuisinart (opens in new tab) and Target (opens in new tab) are selling it for its full price of $169. It includes a 1 Qt. Open Pour Saucepan, 1.5 Qt. Saucepan w/ Cover, 3 Qt. Sauté Pan w/ Cover, 6 Qt. Stockpot w/ Cover, 8-inch Skillet, 10-inch Skillet, and Lid Organizer.

(Image credit: Samsung) Spend $1,299 on appliances: get free $150 Best Buy gift card (opens in new tab) Best Buy is offering a lot of deals on small kitchen appliances, but large appliances are also on sale. The retailer has a few different sales depending on the brand you're loyal to. For example, you can get a free $150 Best Buy gift card when you buy 3 or more eligible Samsung appliances (priced $1,299 or more).

(Image credit: Samsung) Samsung 75" 4K TV: $849 $578 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) I mentioned earlier how Best Buy is offering really aggressive TV deals and this is an example of what I'm talking about. Right now you can get this 75-inch Samsung 4K TV for just $579. If you check out our guide to 75-inch TV deals, you'll see that it's usually the smaller brands that offer this price point (Insignia, Onn, etc). But now you can get a Samsung at this price. That said, this is an entry-level Samsung TV (part of the manufacturer's 6-Series lineup). It's also somewhat limited in that you only get 2 HDMI ports and a 60Hz panel. But if you're not a gamer and just want a big-screen TV on a low budget, it doesn't get better than this.

(Image credit: Future) Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet: $299 $199 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) The Chromebook Duet is a dazzling iPad killer. In our Lenovo Chromebook Duet review, we said it offers remarkable value with tons of battery life (about 12 hours and 47 minutes in our testing). There are a lot of different versions and configs of the Duet (this one here packs an OLED screen (opens in new tab)), but this model on sale packs a 10.1-inch 1920 x 1200 touch display, MediaTek P60T CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB eMMC. That may sound underpowered, but for Google's Chrome OS it's sufficient for everyday tasks and streaming.

(Image credit: Sony) Gaming sale: buy 2 video games, get 1 free @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) The holidays are a great time to expand your video game collection.

(Image credit: Future) Google Pixel 6a (128GB): $449 $299 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) Looking to upgrade you smartphone ahead of Black Friday, but don't want to be locked into a lengthy contract? Best Buy has you covered as the Google Pixel 6a (128GB) is on sale for $299 (opens in new tab). That's sizeable $150 saving compared to its retail price of $449. There's a lot to like about the Pixel 6a. From its bright 6.1-inch OLED display, to the powerful Tensor chip that keeps it running. In our Pixel 6a review, we called Google's phone the best sub-$500 phone on the market and we found that it delivers better performance than its closest Android rival, the Samsung Galaxy A53. It is also a great camera phone. There are two cameras on the back that deliver an excellent photography experience with a 12.2MP main camera and a second 12MP ultra-wide camera.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future) Galaxy Buds 2: $149 $89 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) Not all earbuds demand a $249 price tag. If you're on a budget, the Galaxy Buds 2 are one of the best wireless earbuds on the market. They features a battery life of up to 7.5 hours (with ANC off), Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, and colorful options. In our Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 review, we said they provide a pleasant mobile listening experience without breaking the bank. Not a fan of the color? Amazon offers a few more color options (opens in new tab) for the same price.

(Image credit: Future) MacBook Pro 14" (M1 Pro/512GB): $1,999 $1,599 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) The MacBook Pro 14-inch isn't expected to get a full refresh until 2023, but the current model is one of the best laptops you can buy period. And right now you can get it for just $1,599, which is $400 off its standard price and its lowest price ever. This system is powered by Apple's powerful M1 Pro CPU, which delivers 8 more GPU cores, a better Media Engine, and more memory bandwidth than the already fast M1 chip.
