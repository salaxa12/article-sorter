As Halo Infinite's Winter Update arrives, 343 Industries has taken the time to thank its fans for their patience and support alongside promising shorter seasons, more consistent content drops, and "bigger things to come" in the future.

343 shared the message on Halo Waypoint, saying it knows the journey from Halo Infinite's launch "hasn't been the smoothest or quickest ride." It also said that the Winter Update - which adds match and performance-based XP, the Forge Mode beta, the official launch of online campaign co-op and campaign replay, two new maps, a new battle pass, the Covert One Flag game mode, and more - is a big moment for the studio.

"The Winter Update marks a major step forward for our game and studio, but this is just the first step of that evolution," 343 wrote. "The team is actively working on key player experience priorities across the game to address areas of feedback, and we are targeting another game update before the end of this year.

"Your support is greatly appreciated, and we can’t wait to turn this corner with you all in 2023 as we look to shorter seasons, a more regular stream of content, and bigger things to come."

One of the biggest complaints players have had in regard to Halo Infinite besides the initial controversial multiplayer progression was the lack of a steady stream of new content. In April, 343 said it understands the "community is simply out of patience." It said it needed some time to get the ship back on track, and it appears to be in a good place now to do so.
