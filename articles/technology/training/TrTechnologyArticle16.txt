Demand for the PS5 hasn't been affected by the console's recent price increase, Sony has said. As part of the firm's Q2 2022 earnings call, chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki explained Sony will have enough stock to meet demand during the upcoming holiday season. "So far, due to the price increase, we have not seen any dampening of the demand but we have to monitor what will happen in the market going forward."

Sony increased the price of a PS5 system in late August by £30/€50/5,000 yen, but the price in the USA stayed the same. At the time, the company said the increase was "a necessity given the current global economic environment and its impact on SIE’s business". However, it also stressed it wanted to improve the PS5 Stock situation by having more units on the market.

As we approach Christmas, Sony says it has 6.5 million PS5 consoles already produced for the busy shopping season, but it still has a lot more work to do if it wants to hit its target of 18 million systems shipped during the current fiscal year.
