A native PS5 version of the outstanding Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is releasing on 15th November, but according to developer Tribute Games, it’ll be “identical” to the existing PS4 release and “doesn’t include any additional features or content”. As such, there’ll be no free PS4 to PS5 upgrade option available.

We’re not entirely sure why the Canadian developer’s decided to do this, but it all seems to be related to a physical Limited Run Games release, which is available to pre-order in a variety of permutations. The standard option costs just $34.99, but the most expensive Radical Edition costs an eye-watering $199.99, and includes a whole slew of goodies, including a VHS-style case and a mini arcade cabinet.

If you’re in Europe, then you’ll be able to get a bog-standard physical copy from Merge Games for £34.99, or a Special Edition from Signature Games for £59.99. Of course, if you’re not interested in physical copies and already enjoyed this game via the PS4 version’s backwards compatibility, you can probably skip on this so-called new-gen upgrade – it’s effectively the same game.
