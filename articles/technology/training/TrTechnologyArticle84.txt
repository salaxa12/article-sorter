Cosmic horror RPG WORLD OF HORROR will exit Early Access and launch for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via Steam, GOG, Microsoft Store, and Itch.io in summer 2023, publisher Ysbryd Games and developer Panstasz announced.

WORLD OF HORROR first launched in Early Access for PC on February 20, 2020.

Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:

About The Old Gods are reawakening, clawing their way back into a world that’s spiraling into madness. In hospitals, abandoned classrooms, quiet apartments, and dark forests, strange appearances and unexplainable phenomena test the sanity of residents in Shiokawa, Japan. Is it chaotic retribution, or the machinations of beings beyond our comprehension? This is WORLD OF HORROR: The end of the world is nigh, and the only solution is to confront the terror reigning over the apocalypse. Navigate this hellish, roguelite reality through turn-based combat and unforgiving choices in this roguelite-style cosmic horror RPG. Invoke dark rituals, uncover disturbing clues, and solve puzzles across multiple randomized mysteries. Each perplexing case unravels into a series of random encounters with nightmarish figures inspired by the works of horror legends Junji Ito and H.P. Lovecraft. Key Features Choose from five unique characters and solve over 10 mysteries in Early Access.

Most mysteries harbor multiple endings—for those that survive long enough.

Acclaimed wordsmith Cassandra Khaw (Hammers On Bone) lends her talents to the words articulating the game’s terrors.

A haunting chiptune soundtrack accentuates the game’s stark 1-bit art style, drawn 100 percent in Microsoft Paint.
