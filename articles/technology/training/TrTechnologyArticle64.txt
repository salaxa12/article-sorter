Kinda Funny Games journalist, Imran Khan, has stated that Platinum Games latest opus Bayonetta 3 was originally planned as a semi-open world game, but the idea was scrapped as it fell apart due to pacing and the limitations of Nintendo’s hardware. Khan also said that Nintendo asked Platinum Games to scale back on that particular idea. Digital Foundry recently said in their analysis that “the game also reveals an aging technology base that crumbles under the weight of its scope and scale. This is a game where it feels as if the entire production is in search of more powerful hardware that has never arrived.” So it is probably for the best that they ultimately dropped the idea. Despite this, Platinum Games created a truly fantastic action game with our reviewer giving Bayonetta 3 a 9/10.

“The design was going to draw more off Astral Chain than Nier Automata, but the idea was that a large hub world would send Bayonetta (or whoever else) to different worlds which would themselves be fairly open. Maybe Super Mario 64 would be a good reference point for this. There was a lot of work and experimentation on this idea, but it kept falling apart when it came to pacing, and eventually Nintendo wanted them to scale back. It was, I hear, also not particularly well-performing on the Switch hardware either.” Kinda Funny Games, Imran Khan
