The classic factory keeps rolling, with Niantic bringing back Community Day Classic in a big way to help close out the Season of Light in Pokémon Go. This time, players will be encountering an increased number of Dratini, giving them plenty of chances to train up the young Dragon-type into a formidable Dragonite before the event ends.

Just like with most Community Day events, players will also have an increased chance of encountering a Shiny Dratini along with extra bonuses such as triple Catch Stardust and Lure Modules or Incense activated during the event lasting for three hours.

Any Dratini or Dragonair that is evolved into Dragonite during the event will also know the Charged Attack Draco Meteor.

Along with those bonuses, players can complete exclusive Field Research or purchase a $1 ticket from the in-game shop to access the Special Research story: Dratini Community Day Classic for additional rewards. Here are all of the research tasks and rewards that apply to both tracks.
