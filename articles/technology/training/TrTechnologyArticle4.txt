Apple has released iOS 16.1.1, iPadOS 16.1.1, and macOS Ventura 13.0.1 with bug fixes, minus the expected iPhone 14 Emergency SOS via Satellite feature.

The new updates were expected as there was an ongoing issue with Apple's ad network that needed an update to address. Speculation suggested that Emergency SOS via Satellite would be activated in iPhone 14 models with this update, but that hasn't arrived yet.

Available updates include iOS 16.1.1, iPadOS 16.1.1, and macOS Ventura 13.0.1. Release notes only contain a vague bug fix and security update statement.

Users should see a notification for the update, and it will install automatically overnight for most. However, if you'd like the update to install right away, it will need to be initiated manually.
