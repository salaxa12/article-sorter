Warzone 2 and Modern Warfare 2 Season 1 will arrive with a brand-new Battle Pass system that gets rid of linear progression, here’s everything you need to know.

Modern Warfare 2 has been breaking records like crazy, becoming the best-selling Call of Duty game of all time, and the game hasn’t even had its first season of content yet.

With Modern Warfare 2 Season 1 set to arrive soon, bringing Warzone 2, new weapons, and the return of both Shoot House and Shipment, players are excited to grind their way through an entirely new Battle Pass.

Having said that, the grind will be slightly different this time, as Activision have decided to revamp the way in which the Battle Pass works for both Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2, so let’s get into the details.

How to level up Battle Pass in Warzone 2 & Modern Warfare 2

In Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2 Season 1, players will be progressing through the Battle Pass with “more choices and more agency than ever before.”

Activision have scrapped the “linear stream of tiers” for a new “multi-Sector map.” Now, players will be looking at a map and using earned Battle Pass Token Tier Skips to unlock items across the map, which will be themed for whichever season the game is in.

The Battle Pass map will have “at least 20 Sectors with five items in each Sector,” adding up to 100 items. This new system allows players to pick and choose which items they would like at any given moment, rather than unlocking a certain item at a certain Tier in the old system.

Players will have control over how they wish to spend their Battle Pass Token Tier Skips, deciding whether they’d like a new Operator skin or one of the new weapons.

Players will need to decide which Sector is most enticing to them, pick it, then start unlocking the items with Tokens.
