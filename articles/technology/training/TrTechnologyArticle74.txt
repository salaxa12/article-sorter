Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is fast approaching – and brings with it a number of new features.

One of these new features is something called Proximity chat – but what is it, and how do you use it? Here’s everything you need to know about Warzone 2 proximity chat ahead of its release.

Early Black Friday deals are starting to go live on Amazon & Best Buy . Big brands such as Lenovo and Samsung are also starting to offer Black Friday discounts early, with many more to follow.

Warzone 2 proximity chat

In short, proximity chat will feature in both DMZ and Warzone 2. It allows players to chat at volume levels that differ depending on their distance.

In other words, if the player is close, you’ll hear them more clearly as though they are next to you. If far away, that’ll be reflected in their volume and they’ll sound more distant.

But it doesn’t stop there. You’ll also be able to hear your allies. So if one of them says ‘rush them!’, you’ll be able to listen to that and act accordingly.

This all makes for a far more immersive and tense battle royale experience, and layers on a much-needed human element to the already stellar shooter.

For example, squads will now have to stick together if they’re to communicate – rather than going alone. It’ll test teamwork and communication, with the idea of adding even more competitive strategy to the battle royale.

The downside is that for those more casual players, this level of realism may not be as well received – and it will take some getting used to if you’re the type of player who likes to run off, do their own thing, and then regroup later on.

Can you turn off proximity chat in Warzone 2

There is no word yet on whether you’re able to switch off this feature – although this does seem unlikely. Not being able to hear some people yet they hear you would put you at a distinct disadvantage.

Warzone 2 is set to launch on November 16, and will be free to play as per Warzone 1.
