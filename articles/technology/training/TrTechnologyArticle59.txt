Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II's raids, a shiny new co-op mode that continues the campaign's story, will only feature a boss to battle in the third season. Bit of a shock for those who were refining their skills for the debut on 14 December.

Dataminer and leaker GhostOfSaba has been scouring the game's files for upcoming content for Season 1 and their search has been fruitful. As well as stumbling upon a list of possible maps that are on their way, including Shipment, Shoothouse, and Valderas Museum, they've found that there likely won't be a boss in the raid for Season 1.

Call of Duty has never had raids, but, the description from Activision seems to suggest that these excursions will function in the same fashion as those in Destiny 2. "Each seasonal phase will advance our ongoing story, as old friends and new enemies tie-up loose ends," said Activision in October, setting three players the challenge of thinking strategically to triumph in combat encounters. So it's strange that it looks like the trio won't have a big bad to take down.
