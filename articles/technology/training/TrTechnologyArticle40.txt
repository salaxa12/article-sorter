The Pokemon franchise is not just a Nintendo IP. It’s actually owned by 3 different companies. Nintendo, Creatures Inc. and Game Freak are all involved in the development process of new Pokemon games. One of the 3 companies, Creatures Inc., has been discovered by a Reddit user to be currently hiring.

They are currently looking for a 3D CG modeler, according to a recent job listing. However, what makes the job listing somewhat interesting is that it mentions “research and development for other next-generation hardware”. It also mentions the Unity and Unreal Engine video game engines as in the same service overview that the job listing has.
