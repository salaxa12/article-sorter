Like many retailers, Best Buy is offering hundreds of deals as part of an early Black Friday shopping event during the first few weeks of November. Unlike Walmart, which is dividing up its early Black Friday sale into three events, Best Buy's sale is one massive ongoing sale leading up to November 25.

Best Buy's sale covers basically everything on the retailer's website and stores, including TVs, computers, video games, cell phones, appliances, headphones, tablets, smart home, and more. You can keep track of our ongoing seasonal deal coverage in our dedicated Black Friday roundup.
