Since the NVIDIA GeForce, RTX 4090 graphics card came out about a month ago, at least 100,000 of them have been sold, according to data.

Even though the product costs more than $1,500, many people have bought the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090. Note that 100,000 units do not equal the total number of GPUs made or sold. Instead, it is the number of chips that were sent to partners so they could make RTX 4090 models. The AD102-300 chip in the GeForce RTX 4090 has 16384 CUDA cores and a clock speed of 2520 MHz (with boost mode). The card has 1 TB of bandwidth and 24 GB of GDDR6X memory.
