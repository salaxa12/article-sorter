Yes and no. Every deal is different. It's true SOME deals, especially new AAA, might be based on how many potential Day 1 sales they are taking off other platforms, hence Xbox with a smaller market share might have to pay more. At the same time we learned from Epic v Apple documents and have seen it in some PS+ payment & Capcom leaks that many of these deals are based on number of expected downloads, therefore in other cases Xbox would pay less for a game on Game Pass as there are effectively giving away less copies than they would on PS. Win some, lose some.

Regardless I said RELATIVELY level playing field. It's never going to be 100% even. The key point is there is nothing stopping Microsoft, or anyone else, doing this. That is open competition.

What if they did? What if they used their money... to just outbid Sony for all exclusivity deals? Wouldn't that be anticompetitive too? So what's the difference?

Good question. The KEY difference would be IF Microsoft was doing it in such a way that prevented smaller companies from competing. Would they just be spending WAY over the odds in a manner that limits fair competition or paying a fair market value. It's a complex issue but that is one of the things antitrust and anti-competitive commissions are looking for.

Should a company the size of MS just not be allowed to do business? Someone was going to buy ABK.... Should MS be penalized for being one of the handful of entities who can afford it?

Again good question. No one is stopping MS doing business but it is the SCALE of the business they are looking into. It may be that the commissions would want ABK broken up, as often happens in M&A, to prevent one company getting too strong. This is the point of them. While understandably unpopular here with many Xbox owners the EC commission is rightly just doing their job correctly here. A merging of the #4 & #6 publishers to potentially become #2 IS precisely the sort of thing they should be investigating in depth. Take our bias out of it and i'm sure you can see that makes sense. MS are aware of it and knew how long it would take, hence they initially suggested it might take over a year and complete in 2023. I still expect that to happen, but hope there may be some safeguards to prevent walled gardens being too severe in future.

CoD and Candy Crush might be the only things that survive that. That would suck.

A fatalistic view. ABK is much more than these two. Far more likely is in other caring hands the IP they have let languish to concentrate on so few, especially COD, would be allowed to flourish. Everything from Crash Bandicoot, Guitar Hero, THPS, True Crime/Sleeping Dogs, Pitfall, Tenchu, & Zork (one of my early favourites) might have a change to rise unshackled by a publisher obsessed with annual COD releases. More likely that would be great!
