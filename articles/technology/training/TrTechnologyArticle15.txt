Popular trophies/achievements guide writer PowerPyx has revealed a spoiler-free list of God of War Ragnarok trophies, and they seem as easy as you’ve come to expect from Sony’s first-party studios. Upon first look, the trophy list appears to be similar to 2018’s God of War. However, this time around, players have over 70 accessibility options to choose from and since difficulty doesn’t affect trophies, it looks this will be one very, very easy Platinum for the average player. That said, there are plenty of collectible-related trophies so easy doesn’t equal short and sweet.
