We’re starting to see another round of leaks for Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet, revealing looks at new Pokemon like the evolution for Pawmi and more. Centro Leaks has been sharing the latest content.

This has been the third major leak within the past week. After copies starting getting their way out to fans likely due to retailers selling the games early, access is starting to become more widespread. Initial leaks showed us Pokemon like the evolution for Fuecoco. Then a couple of days ago, we got a look at evolutions for all of the starters and more.

The latest Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet leaks show the evolution for Pawmi known as Pawmo. We’re also able to see the Hammer Pokemon Tinkaton, who is described as an “intelligent Pokemon” with a “very daring deposition” that “knocks rocks into the sky with its hammer, aiming for flying Corviknight. That’s along with Tadbulb, Bellibolt’s pre-evolution, a better look at Quaxwell (the final evolution for Quaxly), Capsakid (who evolves into the two-headed pepper creature we previously saw), the Dark dog Maschiff, Jettison Pokemon Veluza, Charcadet (Armarounge / Ceruledge pre-evolution), Frill Pokemon Flittle, Spidops, Tentacool convergent species (name unknown), and Couple Pokemon Tandemaus. We’ll update this post if any other immediate information comes to light.

Here’s a gallery showing off Pawmo and more in Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet:

Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet will be available for Switch on November 18, 2022.

Update: Leaks for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet have continued, and we’ve updated the gallery above at the end with two Legendary Pokemon. Other than that, you can check out Dachsbun (Fidough final evolution), Bombirdier, Wattrel, Paldean Tauros, Dudunsparce (Dunsparce evolution), Espathra, and Naclstack (evolution for Nacli).
