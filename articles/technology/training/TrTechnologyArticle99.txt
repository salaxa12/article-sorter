If the latest Google phones strike your fancy, plan on stopping by Google's online store next week. The company is teasing Black Friday deals across its product lineup, highlighted by a big discount on its new Pixel 7 lineup.

Starting next Thursday (November 17), the price on the Pixel 7 drops by $100 to $499, while the Pixel 7 Pro falls $150 to $749. Even better, those lower prices don't require you to do anything other than pay for the phone — you don't have to trade in your current device or commit to wireless service from a particular phone carrier.

Google plans to take $100 off the price of its new Pixel 7 flagship when its Black Friday sale gets underway November 17. Prefer the larger Pixel 7 Pro and its telephoto lens? The price on that phone is dropping $150 to $749.

The Pixel 7 models aren't the only phones getting a discount a week from now. The Pixel 6a, already priced at a low $449, is getting a $150 discount of its own. That brings the cost of Google's budget phone below $300 — a very attractive price for a phone that boasts the best cameras among budget devices.

Also on November 17, Google takes $150 off the Pixel 6a as part of a Black Friday promotion. The Pixel 6a is already one of the more appealing affordable phones thanks to its cameras; with the price dropping under $300, you'll want to snap up this budget handset.

That $299 price for the Pixel 6a is the lowest price we've seen for Google's midrange model. It matches a since-discontinued deal that Amazon was offering earlier this month. (As of this writing, Amazon is selling the Pixel 6a for $399 (opens in new tab), so it pays to wait for Google's Black Friday sale to begin.)

The Pixel 6a tops our rankings of the best cheap phones because of its superior cameras and the fact that you get the same Tensor processor that powered 2021's Pixel 6 phones. That means you can experience the machine learning-powered software experiences available on Google's phones, but for much less than you'd pay for a flagship.

Speaking of flagships, Google's phones are priced much lower than the iPhone 14 and Galaxy S22, even before next week's discount. With Google's reduced pricing coming to the Pixel 7 lineup, you'll be able to pick up one of the best camera phones for as little as $499. As newer phones, these are the lowest Pixel 7 prices we've seen so far.

In addition to the discounts on phones, Google's Black Friday sale will also usher in discounts on its Nest products, earbuds and streaming tools. Here's a roundup of the deals Google is teasing in advance of its sale.
