The iPhone 14 and 13 are more or less just the same with just a few tweaks here and there. That being the reason, not a lot of people are looking to upgrade their old iPhone model to the iPhone 14 instead, waiting for the iPhone 15.

By Sneha Saha: Apple launched the iPhone 14 just a few months ago, but consumers do not seem to be too excited about the new iPhone model. That’s because the iPhone 14 isn't a very big upgrade over its predecessor iPhone 13. The iPhone 14 and 13 are more or less just the same with just a few tweaks here and there. That being the reason, not a lot of people are looking to upgrade their old iPhone model to the iPhone 14 instead, waiting for the iPhone 15.

Going by tradition, Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 15 next year around the fall. While there’s still almost a year to go for the next iPhone model to launch, rumours and leaks have already started pouring in and revealing details about the iPhone 14 successor. If rumours are considered, Apple is going to make big changes to the iPhone 15, which hasn’t been the case with iPhone 14 this year, possibly due to supply chain constraints.

Next year, Apple is expected to bring some big changes to the iPhone 15. Let’s take a quick look at the new features we expect to see in the next iPhone model.

-Better hardware: The iPhone 14 comes with an old processor, the one that runs the iPhone 13. But that probably will not be the case with the iPhone 15. The upcoming iPhone model is tipped to come with a new bionic chipset, the A17 Bionic chip. This year, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus come with an A15 Bionic chip, while the Pro models come with an A16 Bionic chip. Some reports also suggest that the iPhone 15 will continue to source modem chips from Qualcomm for the 2023 iPhone lineup.

-USB Type C: EU has made using a common USB Type C charger for all mobile phones mandatory. The policy applies to Apple as well. So, we can expect future iPhone models to offer a USB Type C port instead of lightning port. India is also considering introducing a common charger policy very soon. The government is currently in talks.

-Dynamic Island: Apple introduced a different style of notch called Dynamic Island this year but is available only in Pro models. It is expected that Dynamic Island will be introduced in all iPhone 15 models. Will Apple finally get rid of the wide-notched design that it introduced with the iPhone X? Time will say that.

-Periscope lens: We have been hearing about Apple working on a Periscope lens for years now. It is likely that we may finally see the much-awaited Periscope lens in iPhone 15 models and this will introduce optical zoom capabilities. It is said that with a periscope lens, Apple may offer 5x or 10x optical zoom up from 3x in the current iPhone 14 Pro models.

-Better battery life: With every model, Apple is improving the battery life of the iPhones. The iPhone 14 offers slightly better battery life when compared to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 and the same tradition will be followed with the iPhone 15. In other words, we can expect the iPhone 15 to last easily for one full day.
