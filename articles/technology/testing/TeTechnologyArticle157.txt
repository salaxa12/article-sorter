Microcenter is offering all sorts of tempting Intel/AMD processor-motherboard bundles, with the Ryzen 5 3600 and a B450M board going for a low price of $129. The Gigabyte B450M DSH3 WiFi paired with the hex-core Zen 3 chip, albeit a little dated, is an excellent option for simple workstations.

The more capable duo of the Ryzen 7 5800X and the MSI B550 MAG is available for a mouthwatering price of $349.98. Perhaps not the fastest, but it should be more than enough to satisfy even the fastest graphics card.

The Core i7-12700K is still one of the fastest gaming processors, the best if you ignore the Ryzen 7000 and 13th Gen Core offerings. Asus’ Z690 Plus TUF Gaming WiFi DDR4 can be purchased with a 12700K for a combined price of just $349.99.

There are a bunch of other worthy combos over at Microcenter, most notably the Ryzen 5 5600G/ASUS B550M-A Prime and Ryzen 5 5600X/ASUS B550M-A Prime. You can check them out below:
