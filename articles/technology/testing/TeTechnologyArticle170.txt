Earlier this year, we reported that Nihon Falcom had confirmed that Ys X was in development - and that the company was planning to release more titles for Nintendo Switch following their release of The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails Ad Astra. Now, with the company's most recent earnings release, we've got a slew of new information about their plans for the platform.

First, Ys X has now been confirmed for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. It's planned to release next year in Japan, and will presumably be the company's major release for the year. Still, in addition to that, the company has stated that they plan to release 3 Nintendo Switch titles developed by Falcom themselves within the year. While the other titles besides Ys X have yet to be confirmed at this time, Falcom did state earlier this year that they wanted to port The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki to the platform if it was at all possible, and if the company is planning to pursue Switch more seriously, then porting both Kuro no Kiseki and Kuro no Kiseki II: Crimson Sin would probably fit the bill nicely.

Other noteworthy announcements from the release include the company's desire to further strengthen their IPs in The Legend of Heroes and Ys, while still striving for "fresh and challenging" new titles for the future; though, it should be noted that they stress that these two series are still a part of that aspiration. No new IPs or revivals were explicitly confirmed or teased with tonight's announcements.

Ys X will release on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 in Japan next year - most likely at the end of September. Presumably, a localization for the title will come after the game's Japanese release, though we'll have to wait and see exactly when such an announcement might arrive.
