Evo Japan 2023 is scheduled to take begin on March 31, 2023 and last until April 2, 2023. It's been confirmed that registration for the event will begin on November 20, 2022 at 12:00 JST.

As always, this will give spectators another great opportunity to see some of the best players of their respective games going at it for prize money and prestige. Thus far, we have confirmation that there will be at least seven different fighting game tournaments that players will compete in.

The confirmed games so far are Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition, Tekken 7, King of Fighters 15, Guilty Gear Strive, Granblue Fantasy: Versus, Melty Blood: Type Lumina, and Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown.

Although it was initially believed that Street Fighter 6 could release around February 2023, a recent statement to investors made it clear that the only major Capcom title that's releasing from now until March 31, 2023 is Resident Evil 4 Remake (release date of March 24, 2023).

While there's still a chance that Street Fighter 6 could still end up being part of Evo Japan 2023's lineup, the likelihood of this happening isn't looking that strong at the moment. Of course, it's worth mentioning that the Evo Japan 2023 staff have not yet confirmed that these will be all the fighting games present at the big event.

It's also interesting how Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate haven't been announced for the event. Notably, neither game was present at Evo 2022, likely due to Nintendo.

Possible reasons for Nintendo's absence from the event include the company wanting to distance itself from the controversy surrounding Evo 2020 and its cancelation, Sony's acquisition of the Evo brand, and the fact that they are now holding their own Super Smash Bros. tournament circuit, although it should be noted that nothing is confirmed on this front.

We'll just have to wait and see if any additional fighting games get added to Evo Japan 2023's lineup.
