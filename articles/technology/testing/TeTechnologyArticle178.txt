Anish Kattukaran, Director of Product Management for Google Home & Nest, released a blog post back in October that detailed everything coming with the new Google Home app. In addition to a complete redesign, the new app is built from the ground up for Matter, the new smart home standard that officially launched this year.

With updates on Matter for Android and Nest devices, and a new and improved Google Home app, we’re taking a big step towards that vision. Whether you have a few smart lights or are a smart home enthusiast with dozens of connected devices, the Google Home app will improve your smart home experience.

It’s still unclear when the new Google Home app will launch to everyone but, if you want to test it out now, feel free to sign up for the public preview.
