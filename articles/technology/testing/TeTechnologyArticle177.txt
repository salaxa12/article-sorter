Last month, Google announced a redesign of the Home app that promised to bring more device compatibility, courtesy of the Matter standard, and customization options that will allow each user to personalize their experience further. This announcement came with a timeline tied to a Public Preview that was to become available for users to sign up. We have been waiting for this Public Preview to become available ever since, and it’s finally rolling out starting today.

Google has confirmed its availability via a blog post today, which will require a signup via the Home app’s settings. While the rollout has already begun, as it usually goes with these things, it may take a few more days or weeks to reach your device. Meanwhile, Google is offering the below disclaimer in regards to signing up for the Public Preview in order to try out the new Google Home app features:

Public Preview features are early and not complete. They may have issues that can cause the app to behave unexpectedly or not perform as well as the standard app. You can opt out at any time. Leaving the program is as easy as hitting a button in the Public Preview menu, available under Settings. We do not provide the ability to turn off individual features. Google Nest Community Blog

Additionally, Google is encouraging users that sign up to try out the new app to submit feedback as they are using it in order to help make the app even more useful. To request an invite, open the Google Home app and select Settings > Public Preview > Request invite. However, you will not be able to start using the features right away, as you have to wait for the invite to be accepted and for the new features to be completed and ready for you to use. Once you are set, you should see a notification letting you know.
