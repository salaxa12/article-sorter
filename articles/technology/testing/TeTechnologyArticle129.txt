Shortly after the game's grand release date reveal, developer Mundfish is back again with another 10 minutes of crazy Atomic Heart footage. This time, the team has shown off a full boss fight as part of IGN First's month of coverage.

The lengthy clip showcases quite a varied boss battle — certainly one more complex than in your average first person shooter — with some pretty impressive attack variety on show. Here's a description of the fight, straight from the video overview:

"Meet Hedgie in this Atomic Heart boss fight gameplay, which introduces us to a giant mechanical ball boss. This brand new gameplay captured by developer, Mundfish, gives us an idea of what to expect from the upcoming action RPG’s robotic enemies and their abilities. Showcasing some of the skills and weapons players will have at their disposal when this FPS launches next year, this intense fight demonstrates just how challenging Atomic Heart’s combat is. From taking shots with an arsenal of powerful weapons to hacking away at Hedgie with an axe, here’s a taste of what’s to come."

Mundfish's crazy first-person shooter launches next February, including a day one Xbox Game Pass release!
