Even though the Sony WH-1000XM4 have been released more than two years ago, they are still a fine choice for buyers who are in the market for a well-performing pair of wireless headphones with an incredibly effective noise-cancellation function and a ridiculously long battery life.

A decent pair of over-ear wireless headphones with active noise cancellation has become indispensable for many people who live or commute in crowded urban areas that can certainly increase one's stress levels due to the omnipresent noise pollution. Although their direct successor was launched earlier this year, Sony's WH-1000XM4 remain one of the more popular choices in this crowded segment of wireless ANC headphones.

Fortunately, these sleek noise-cancelling headphones have now been discounted by a significant margin and therefore dropped to their lowest price ever according to the price tracker at Camelcamelcamel. Well-known US retailers like Amazon and Best Buy currently sell the aforementioned Sony WH-1000XM4 for just US$228, which is a considerable US$122 or 35 percent discount in comparison to the official list price. This deal applies for the traditional black, and the fancier blue and silver color variants as well, but there may be limited quantities available at this discounted sale price.

Tech enthusiasts may already know that the Sony WH-1000XM4 are equipped with good-sounding 1.57-inch drivers, and the experts at Rtings.com have also praised these premium headphones for their comfortable fit as well as the outstanding noise-cancelling performance. They also have an extremely long continuous battery life of more than 37 hours, which means that these headphones are also perfect for frequent travelers who would like to black out the annoying rumbling of a plane engine. For a steeply discounted sale price of just US$228, the Sony WH-1000XM4 are certainly a sensible choice in comparison to the much more expensive successor, which currently cost a whopping US$349 and do not perform better in some regards.
