Developer Nihon Falcom’s latest financial report shows that the next title in the Ys franchise to celebrate its 35-year anniversary will launch for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. Ys X is not explicitly stated, but it’s highly likely that the company is referring to that, considering how it’s already been announced.

Additionally, three Nintendo Switch Falcom games are set to launch in Japan within the fiscal year of September 2023. We’ll be sure to provide more details on these developments as they arrive.

A native PlayStation 5 version of Ys IX: Monstrum Nox was announced for Spring 2023.
