By most definitions and easily made observations, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is not Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, a 2009 installment of the game with a very similar name but, as you can see, a 2 instead of a II. Their stories are different. Their mechanics are different. As we discussed, one has a 2 instead of a II.
