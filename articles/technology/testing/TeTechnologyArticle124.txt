Samsung recently rolled out the Android 13-based One UI 5 stable update for the Galaxy A53 5G, and now it has begun testing One UI 5.0 for the Galaxy A33 5G internally. Its firmware has version A336EDXU4BVK1, but don't wait for a public beta since there likely won't be one.

Besides, not all regions will get the stable update at the same time. Samsung aims to release One UI 5.0 for the Galaxy A33 5G in South Korea and Germany by the end of this month and in Malaysia next month. That said, the rollout schedule is subject to change, so the update could arrive late or earlier than expected.
