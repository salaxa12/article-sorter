More rumors about next-generation Sony Xperia smartphones have emerged, with claims being made about the camera equipment and sound system for future Xperia devices. Both the Xperia 1 V and Xperia 5 V are allegedly being redesigned to fit their large cameras, while likely the Mark 5 variant of the Xperia 1 could end up with record-breaking speakers.

The 2023 edition of the Sony Xperia 1 is already shaping up to be something of a unique beast in the Android smartphone market, and new rumors about the device have added to that overall impression. First up, there is some supposed news about the camera equipment for both the expected Sony Xperia 1 V and Xperia 5 V. It appears the phones have had to “undergo a major redesign” just to deal with the beefed-up camera equipment that Sony is apparently going to integrate into the 2023 models.

According to the same leaker (mysterious source on Weibo that comes via SumahoDigest), the Xperia 1 V and the Xperia 5 V will sport “approximately” a 1-inch sensor, perhaps in a similar manner and setting to the one found in the Sony Xperia PRO-I. If true, this would be a considerable step-up for both devices over their respective predecessors, and it would also be quite a departure for Sony for these particular ranges. But the prospect of a Sony Xperia 1 V boasting such a large camera that it needs a redesign may even add a little credibility to the second claim: That a next-generation Xperia will feature the world’s loudest speaker (machine translated as "world's largest alarm").

Presumably, this second rumor (also purportedly sourced from Weibo via Reddit) refers to the potential Sony Xperia 1 V rather than a future PRO model, but it is unclear at this stage. While Xperia devices are frequently lauded for their visual prowess and photo-shooting skills, the excellent sound reproduction is often overlooked because of the other bells and whistles that these expensive Android phones can offer. It’s quite a challenge, as this Xperia 1 V or PRO-II’s speakers would have to beat out loud gaming devices such as the ZTE Nubia Red Magic 6 and Asus ROG Phone 5 to match such hyperbole. More realistically, for now, Xperia fans can hope for an overhauled sound system for a 2023 Xperia flagship.
