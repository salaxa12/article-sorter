The glory of taking down a whole squad of heavily armed enemy soldiers while running from grenade explosions and taking cover from snipers...is even better when it’s free. Right now, there are two FPS war games you can download and play right now, for free, on your PC: Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and Rising Storm 2: Vietnam. But the freebies aren’t going to last for long.

Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory

If you grew up playing first-person shooter games on your PC in the ‘90s, you might recognize the name Wolfenstein. It is an old franchise that has amassed a loyal cult following since they launched their first 3-D first-person shooter game Wolfenstein 3-D in 1992.

Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is the fifth game in the Wolfenstein line of games. It is a WW2 shooter game with multiple maps, unique objectives, and and a variety of weapons and gadgets to choose from. The game hosts a maximum of 32 players at once, and you can choose to play as an engineer, medic, soldier, field ops, or covert ops.

It was originally released in 2003, but after 19 years of fans keeping the game alive with video game modifications to allow multiplayer games and custom maps, the official game developers, Splash Damage and Bethesda Softworks , have released official servers in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and the UK to play the original game online with a multiplayer option. The game can be downloaded through Steam here.
